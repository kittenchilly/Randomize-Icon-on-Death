# Randomize Icon on Death

Everytime you die or restart a level, it randomizes your icons and colors. Only chooses ones you have unlocked.
For people that really can't decide what to use.

# Known issues
- Progress bar and objects set to match player color currently don't update properly when icon is randomized in a level
- GLOBED: Icon doesn't update on other player's screens when randomized in a level
- GLOBED: Player indicator in progress bar doesn't update when icon is randomized in a level
